The following describes a basic user sign-in system:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user sends sign-in credentials to the server, for example via a form submission.</li>
<li>If the credentials are correct, the server updates the UI to indicate that the user is signed in, and responds with a cookie containing a session ID that records their sign-in status on the browser.</li>
<li>At a later time, the user moves to a different page on the same site. The browser sends the cookie containing the session ID along with the corresponding request to indicate that it still thinks the user is signed in.</li>
<li>The server checks the session ID and, if it is still valid, sends the user a personalized version of the new page. If it is not valid, the session ID is deleted and the user is shown a generic version of the page (or perhaps shown an "access denied" message and asked to sign in again).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Cookies/cookie-basic-example.png" alt="visual representation of the above sign-in system description" width="800" height="531" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Cookies are mainly used for three purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Session management</strong>: User sign-in status, shopping cart contents, game scores, or any other user session-related details that the server needs to remember.</li>
<li><strong>Personalization</strong>: User preferences such as display language and UI theme.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking</strong>: Recording and analyzing user behavior.</li>
</ul></div></section><section aria-labelledby="data_storage"><h3 id="data_storage"><a href="#data_storage">Data storage</a></h3><div class="section-content"><p>In the early days of the web when there was no other option, cookies were used for general client-side data storage purposes. Modern storage APIs are now recommended, for example the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API">Web Storage API</a> (<code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>) and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">IndexedDB</a>.</p>
<p>They are designed with storage in mind, never send data to the server, and don't come with other drawbacks of using cookies for storage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browsers are generally limited to a maximum number of cookies per domain (varies by browser, generally in the hundreds), and a maximum size per cookie (usually 4KB). Storage APIs can store larger amounts of data.</li>
<li>Cookies are sent with every request, so they can worsen performance (for example on slow mobile data connections), especially if you have a lot of cookies set.</li>
</ul>

A cookie is set by specifying a name-value pair like this:</p>
<div class="code-example"><div class="example-header"><span class="language-name">http</span></div><pre class="brush: http notranslate"><code>Set-Cookie: &lt;cookie-name&gt;=&lt;cookie-value&gt;

Depending on the attributes set within the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie"><code>Set-Cookie</code></a> header when the cookies are created, they can be either <em>permanent</em> or <em>session</em> cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Permanent cookies are deleted after the date specified in the <code>Expires</code> attribute:</p>
<div class="code-example"><div class="example-header"><span class="language-name">http</span></div><pre class="brush: http notranslate"><code>Set-Cookie: id=a3fWa; Expires=Thu, 31 Oct 2021 07:28:00 GMT;

<div class="code-example"><div class="example-header"><span class="language-name">http</span></div><pre class="brush: http notranslate"><code>Set-Cookie: id=a3fWa; Max-Age=2592000
</code></pre></div>
<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
<code>Expires</code> has been available for longer than <code>Max-Age</code>, however <code>Max-Age</code> is less error-prone, and takes precedence when both are set. The rationale behind this is that when you set an <code>Expires</code> date and time, they're relative to the client the cookie is being set on. If the server is set to a different time, this could cause errors.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Session</em> cookies — cookies without a <code>Max-Age</code> or <code>Expires</code> attribute – are deleted when the current session ends. The browser defines when the "current session" ends, and some browsers use <em>session restoring</em> when restarting. This can cause session cookies to last indefinitely.</p>
<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
If your site authenticates users, it should regenerate and resend session cookies, even ones that already exist, whenever a user authenticates. This approach helps prevent <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation" class="external" target="_blank">session fixation</a> attacks, where a third-party can reuse a user's session.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some techniques designed to recreate cookies after they're deleted. These are known as "zombie" cookies. These techniques violate the principles of user <a href="#privacy_and_tracking">privacy</a> and control, may violate <a href="#cookie-related_regulations">data privacy regulations</a>, and could expose a website using them to legal liability.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="updating_cookie_values"><h3 id="updating_cookie_values"><a href="#updating_cookie_values">Updating cookie values</a></h3><div class="section-content"><p>To update a cookie via HTTP, the server can send a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie"><code>Set-Cookie</code></a> header with the existing cookie's name and a new value. For example:</p>
<div class="code-example"><div class="example-header"><span class="language-name">http</span></div><pre class="brush: http notranslate"><code>Set-Cookie: id=new-value
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are several reasons why you might want to do this, for example if a user has updated their preferences and the application wants to reflect the changes in client-side data (you could also do this with a client-side storage mechanism such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API">Web Storage</a>).</p>
<h4 id="updating_cookies_via_javascript">Updating cookies via JavaScript</h4>
<p>In the browser, you can create new cookies via JavaScript using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie"><code>Document.cookie</code></a> property, or the asynchronous <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cookie_Store_API" title="Cookie Store API">Cookie Store API</a>. Note that all examples below use <code>Document.cookie</code>, as it is the most widely supported/established option.</p>
<div class="code-example"><div class="example-header"><span class="language-name">js</span></div><pre class="brush: js notranslate"><code>document.cookie = "yummy_cookie=chocolate";
document.cookie = "tasty_cookie=strawberry";
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also access existing cookies and set new values for them, provided the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#httponly"><code>HttpOnly</code></a> attribute isn't set on them (i.e., in the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header that created it):</p>
<div class="code-example"><div class="example-header"><span class="language-name">js</span></div><pre class="brush: js notranslate"><code>console.log(document.cookie);
// logs "yummy_cookie=chocolate; tasty_cookie=strawberry"

document.cookie = "yummy_cookie=blueberry";

console.log(document.cookie);
// logs "tasty_cookie=strawberry; yummy_cookie=blueberry"
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that, for security purposes, you can't change cookie values by sending an updated <code>Cookie</code> header directly when initiating a request, i.e., via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch" title="fetch()"><code>fetch()</code></a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a>. Note that there are also good reasons why you shouldn't allow JavaScript to modify cookies — i.e., set <code>HttpOnly</code> during creation. See the <a href="#security">Security</a> section for more details.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="security"><h2 id="security"><a href="#security">Security</a></h2><div class="section-content"><p>When you store information in cookies, by default all cookie values are visible to, and can be changed by, the end user. You really don't want your cookies to be misused — for example accessed/modified by bad actors, or sent to domains where they shouldn't be sent. The potential consequences can range from annoying — apps not working or exhibiting strange behavior — to catastrophic. A criminal could for example steal a session ID and use it to set a cookie that makes it look like they are logged in as someone else, taking control of their bank or e-commerce account in the process.</p>
<p>You can secure your cookies in a variety of ways, which are reviewed in this section.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="block_access_to_your_cookies"><h3 id="block_access_to_your_cookies"><a href="#block_access_to_your_cookies">Block access to your cookies</a></h3><div class="section-content"><p>You can ensure that cookies are sent securely and aren't accessed by unintended parties or scripts in one of two ways: with the <code>Secure</code> attribute and the <code>HttpOnly</code> attribute:</p>
<div class="code-example"><div class="example-header"><span class="language-name">http</span></div><pre class="brush: http notranslate"><code>Set-Cookie: id=a3fWa; Expires=Thu, 21 Oct 2021 07:28:00 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A cookie with the <code>Secure</code> attribute is only sent to the server with an encrypted request over the HTTPS protocol. It's never sent with unsecured HTTP (except on localhost), which means <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MitM">man-in-the-middle</a> attackers can't access it easily. Insecure sites (with <code>http:</code> in the URL) can't set cookies with the <code>Secure</code> attribute. However, don't assume that <code>Secure</code> prevents all access to sensitive information in cookies. For example, someone with access to the client's hard disk (or JavaScript if the <code>HttpOnly</code> attribute isn't set) can read and modify the information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cookie with the <code>HttpOnly</code> attribute can't be accessed by JavaScript, for example using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie"><code>Document.cookie</code></a>; it can only be accessed when it reaches the server. Cookies that persist user sessions for example should have the <code>HttpOnly</code> attribute set — it would be really insecure to make them available to JavaScript. This precaution helps mitigate cross-site scripting (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS">XSS</a>) attacks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Depending on the application, you may want to use an opaque identifier that the server looks up rather than storing sensitive information directly in cookies, or investigate alternative authentication/confidentiality mechanisms such as <a href="https://jwt.io/" class="external" target="_blank">JSON Web Tokens</a>.</p>
</div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="define_where_cookies_are_sent"><h3 id="define_where_cookies_are_sent"><a href="#define_where_cookies_are_sent">Define where cookies are sent</a></h3><div class="section-content"><p>The <code>Domain</code> and <code>Path</code> attributes define the <em>scope</em> of a cookie: what URLs the cookies are sent to.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>Domain</code> attribute specifies which server can receive a cookie. If specified, cookies are available on the specified server and its subdomains. For example, if you set <code>Domain=mozilla.org</code> from <code>mozilla.org</code>, cookies are available on that domain and subdomains like <code>developer.mozilla.org</code>.</p>
<div class="code-example"><div class="example-header"><span class="language-name">http</span></div><pre class="brush: http notranslate"><code>Set-Cookie: id=a3fWa; Expires=Thu, 21 Oct 2021 07:28:00 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly; Domain=mozilla.org
</code></pre></div>
<p>If the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header does not specify a <code>Domain</code> attribute, the cookies are available on the server that sets it <em>but not on its subdomains</em>. Therefore, specifying <code>Domain</code> is less restrictive than omitting it.
Note that a server can only set the <code>Domain</code> attribute to its own domain or a parent domain, not to a subdomain or some other domain.
So, for example, a server with domain <code>foo.example.com</code> could set the attribute to <code>example.com</code> or <code>foo.example.com</code>, but not <code>bar.foo.example.com</code> or <code>elsewhere.com</code> (the cookies would still be <em>sent</em> to subdomains such as <code>bar.foo.example.com</code> though).
See <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#invalid_domains">Invalid domains</a> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Path</code> attribute indicates a URL path that must exist in the requested URL in order to send the <code>Cookie</code> header. For example:</p>
<div class="code-example"><div class="example-header"><span class="language-name">http</span></div><pre class="brush: http notranslate"><code>Set-Cookie: id=a3fWa; Expires=Thu, 21 Oct 2021 07:28:00 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/docs
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>%x2F</code> ("/") character is considered a directory separator, and subdirectories match as well. For example, if you set <code>Path=/docs</code>, these request paths match:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/docs</code></li>
<li><code>/docs/</code></li>
<li><code>/docs/Web/</code></li>
<li><code>/docs/Web/HTTP</code></li>
</ul>
<p>But these request paths don't:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/</code></li>
<li><code>/docsets</code></li>
<li><code>/fr/docs</code></li>
</ul>
<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
The <code>path</code> attribute lets you control what cookies the browser sends based on the different parts of a site.
It is not intended as a security measure, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie#security">does not protect</a> against unauthorized reading of the cookie from a different path.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul></div></section><section aria-labelledby="controlling_third-party_cookies_with_samesite"><h3 id="controlling_third-party_cookies_with_samesite"><a href="#controlling_third-party_cookies_with_samesite">Controlling third-party cookies with <code>SameSite</code></a></h3><div class="section-content"><p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value"><code>SameSite</code></a> attribute lets servers specify whether/when cookies are sent with cross-site requests — i.e., <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/Third-party_cookies">third-party cookies</a>. Cross-site requests are requests where the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Site">site</a> (the registrable domain) and/or the scheme (http or https) do not match the site the user is currently visiting. This includes requests sent when links are clicked on other sites to navigate to your site, and any request sent by embedded third-party content.</p>
<p><code>SameSite</code> helps to prevent leakage of information, preserving user <a href="#privacy_and_tracking">privacy</a> and providing some protection against <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF">cross-site request forgery</a> attacks. It takes three possible values: <code>Strict</code>, <code>Lax</code>, and <code>None</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Strict</code> causes the browser to only send the cookie in response to requests originating from the cookie's origin site. This should be used when you have cookies relating to functionality that will always be behind an initial navigation, such as authentication or storing shopping cart information.</p>
<div class="code-example"><div class="example-header"><span class="language-name">http</span></div><pre class="brush: http notranslate"><code>Set-Cookie: cart=110045_77895_53420; SameSite=Strict
</code></pre></div>
<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Cookies that are used for sensitive information should also have a short <a href="#removal_defining_the_lifetime_of_a_cookie">lifetime</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Lax</code> is similar, except the browser also sends the cookie when the user <em>navigates</em> to the cookie's origin site (even if the user is coming from a different site). This is useful for cookies affecting the display of a site — for example you might have partner product information along with an affiliate link on your website. When that link is followed to the partner website, they might want to set a cookie stating that the affiliate link was followed, which displays a reward banner and provides a discount if the product is purchased.</p>
<div class="code-example"><div class="example-header"><span class="language-name">http</span></div><pre class="brush: http notranslate"><code>Set-Cookie: affiliate=e4rt45dw; SameSite=Lax
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>None</code> specifies that cookies are sent on both originating and cross-site requests. This is useful if you want to send cookies along with requests made from third-party content embedded in other sites, for example, ad-tech or analytics providers. Note that if <code>SameSite=None</code> is set then the <code>Secure</code> attribute must also be set — <code>SameSite=None</code> requires a <em>secure context</em>.</p>
<div class="code-example"><div class="example-header"><span class="language-name">http</span></div><pre class="brush: http notranslate"><code>Set-Cookie: widget_session=7yjgj57e4n3d; SameSite=None; Secure; HttpOnly
</code></pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If no <code>SameSite</code> attribute is set, the cookie is treated as <code>Lax</code> by default.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="cookie_prefixes"><h3 id="cookie_prefixes"><a href="#cookie_prefixes">Cookie prefixes</a></h3><div class="section-content"><p>Because of the design of the cookie mechanism, a server can't confirm that a cookie was set from a secure origin or even tell <em>where</em> a cookie was originally set.</p>
<p>An application on a subdomain can set a cookie with the <code>Domain</code> attribute, which gives access to that cookie on all other subdomains. This mechanism can be abused in a <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation" class="external" target="_blank">session fixation</a> attack.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)" class="external" target="_blank">defense-in-depth measure</a>, however, you can use <em>cookie prefixes</em> to assert specific facts about the cookie. Two prefixes are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__Host-</code>: If a cookie name has this prefix, it's accepted in a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie"><code>Set-Cookie</code></a> header only if it's also marked with the <code>Secure</code> attribute, was sent from a secure origin, does <em>not</em> include a <code>Domain</code> attribute, and has the <code>Path</code> attribute set to <code>/</code>. In other words, the cookie is <em>domain-locked</em>.</li>
<li><code>__Secure-</code>: If a cookie name has this prefix, it's accepted in a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie"><code>Set-Cookie</code></a> header only if it's marked with the <code>Secure</code> attribute and was sent from a secure origin. This is weaker than the <code>__Host-</code> prefix.</li>
</ul>
<p>The browser will reject cookies with these prefixes that don't comply with their restrictions. This ensures that subdomain-created cookies with prefixes are either confined to a subdomain or ignored completely. As the application server only checks for a specific cookie name when determining if the user is authenticated or a CSRF token is correct, this effectively acts as a defense measure against <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation" class="external" target="_blank">session fixation</a>.</p>
<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
On the server, the web application <em>must</em> check for the full cookie name including the prefix. User agents <em>do not</em> strip the prefix from the cookie before sending it in a request's <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cookie"><code>Cookie</code></a> header.</p>

Privacy is a very important consideration when building websites which, when done right, can build trust with your users. If done badly, it can completely erode that trust and cause all kinds of other problems.</p>
<p>Third-party cookies can be set by third-party content embedded in sites via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>s. They have many legitimate uses include sharing user profile information, counting ad impressions, or collecting analytics across different related domains.</p>
<p>However, third-party cookies can also be used to create creepy, invasive user experiences. A third-party server can create a profile of a user's browsing history and habits based on cookies sent to it by the same browser when accessing multiple sites. The classic example is when you search for product information on one site and are then chased around the web by adverts for similar products wherever you go.</p>
<p>Browser vendors know that users don't like this behavior, and as a result have all started to block third-party cookies by default, or at least made plans to go in that direction. Third-party cookies (or just tracking cookies) may also be blocked by other browser settings or extensions.</p>
<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Cookie blocking can cause some third-party components (such as social media widgets) not to function as intended. As browsers impose further restrictions on third-party cookies, developers should start to look at ways to reduce their reliance on them.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" class="external" target="_blank">General Data Privacy Regulation</a> (GDPR) in the European Union</li>
<li>The ePrivacy Directive in the EU</li>
<li>The California Consumer Privacy Act</li>
</ul>
<p>These regulations have global reach. They apply to any site on the <em>World Wide</em> Web that users from these jurisdictions access (the EU and California, with the caveat that California's law applies only to entities with gross revenue over 25 million USD, among things).</p>
<p>These regulations include requirements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notifying users that your site uses cookies.</li>
<li>Allowing users to opt out of receiving some or all cookies.</li>
<li>Allowing users to use the bulk of your service without receiving cookies.</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be other regulations that govern the use of cookies in your locality. The burden is on you to know and comply with these regulations. There are companies that offer "cookie banner" code that helps you comply with these regulations.</p>
<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Companies should disclose the types of cookies they use on their sites for transparency purposes and to comply with regulations.
