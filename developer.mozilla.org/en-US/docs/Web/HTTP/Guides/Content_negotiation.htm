You'll find some disadvantages of HTTP content negotiation in <a href="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Why_not_conneg" class="external" target="_blank">a wiki page from WHATWG</a>.

When a client wants to obtain a resource, the client requests it via a URL. The server uses this URL to choose one of the variants available–each variant is called a <em>representation</em>–and returns a specific representation to the client. The overall resource, as well as each of the representations, has a specific URL. <em>Content negotiation</em> determines how a specific representation is chosen when the resource is called. There are several ways of negotiating between the client and the server.</p>
<p><img src="Content_negotiation/httpnego.png" alt="A client requesting a URL. The server has multiple resources represented by the URL and sends back appropriate content based on the request." width="767" height="311" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The best-suited representation is identified through one of two mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers">HTTP headers</a> by the client (<em>server-driven negotiation</em> or <em>proactive negotiation</em>), which is the standard way of negotiating a specific kind of resource.</li>
<li>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/300"><code>300</code></a> (Multiple Choices) or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/406"><code>406</code></a> (Not Acceptable), <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/415"><code>415</code></a> (Unsupported Media Type) <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status">HTTP response codes</a> by the server (<em>agent-driven negotiation</em> or <em>reactive negotiation</em>), that are used as fallback mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the years, other content negotiation proposals, like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2295" class="external" target="_blank">transparent content negotiation</a> and the <code>Alternates</code> header, have been proposed. They failed to get traction and were abandoned.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="server-driven_content_negotiation"><h2 id="server-driven_content_negotiation"><a href="#server-driven_content_negotiation">Server-driven content negotiation</a></h2><div class="section-content"><p>In <em>server-driven content negotiation</em>, or proactive content negotiation, the browser (or any other kind of user agent) sends several HTTP headers along with the URL. These headers describe the user's preferred choice. The server uses them as hints and an internal algorithm chooses the best content to serve to the client. If it can't provide a suitable resource, it might respond with <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/406"><code>406</code></a> (Not Acceptable) or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/415"><code>415</code></a> (Unsupported Media Type) and set headers for the types of media that it does support (e.g., using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Post"><code>Accept-Post</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Patch"><code>Accept-Patch</code></a> for POST and PATCH requests, respectively). The algorithm is server-specific and not defined in the standard. See the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/content-negotiation.html#algorithm" class="external" target="_blank">Apache negotiation algorithm</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Content_negotiation/httpnegoserver.png" alt="A client requesting a URL with headers denoting a preference for content types. The server has multiple resources represented by the URL and sends back the content for the preferred language and compresses the request body based, respecting the client's request headers." width="1127" height="679" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The HTTP/1.1 standard defines list of the standard headers that start server-driven negotiation (such as <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept"><code>Accept</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Encoding"><code>Accept-Encoding</code></a>, and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Language"><code>Accept-Language</code></a>). Though <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/User-Agent"><code>User-Agent</code></a> isn't in this list, it's sometimes also used to send a specific representation of the requested resource. However, this isn't always considered a good practice. The server uses the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Vary"><code>Vary</code></a> header to indicate which headers it actually used for content negotiation (or more precisely, the associated request headers), so that <a href="Caching.htm">caches</a> can work optimally.</p>
<p>In addition to these, there's an experimental proposal to add more headers to the list of available headers, called <em>client hints</em>. Client hints advertise what kind of device the user agent runs on (for example, a desktop computer or a mobile device).</p>
<p>Even if server-driven content negotiation is the most common way to agree on a specific representation of a resource, it has several drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The server doesn't have total knowledge of the browser. Even with the Client Hints extension, it doesn't have a complete knowledge of the capabilities of the browser. Unlike reactive content negotiation where the client makes the choice, the server choice is always somewhat arbitrary.</li>
<li>The information from the client is quite verbose (HTTP/2 header compression mitigates this problem) and a privacy risk (HTTP <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Fingerprinting">fingerprinting</a>).</li>
<li>As several representations of a given resource are sent, shared caches are less efficient and server implementations are more complex.</li>

<p>The <code>Accept</code> header is defined by the browser, or any other user agent, and can vary according to the context. For example, fetching an HTML page or an image, a video, or a script. It's different when fetching a document entered in the address bar or an element linked via an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a>, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/audio"><code>&lt;audio&gt;</code></a> element.

The default value <code>identity</code> is at the lowest priority (unless otherwise noted).</p>
<p>Compressing HTTP messages is one of the most important ways to improve the performance of a website. It shrinks the size of the data transmitted and makes better use of the available bandwidth. Browsers always send this header and the server should be configured to use compression.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="the_accept-language_header"><h3 id="the_accept-language_header"><a href="#the_accept-language_header">The <code>Accept-Language</code> header</a></h3><div class="section-content"><p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Language"><code>Accept-Language</code></a> header is used to indicate the language preference of the user. It's a list of values with quality factors (e.g., <code>de, en;q=0.7</code>). A default value is often set according to the language of the graphical interface of the user agent, but most browsers allow different language preferences to be set.</p>
<p>Due to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/primer-information-theory-and-privacy" class="external" target="_blank">configuration-based entropy</a> increase, a modified value can be used to fingerprint the user. It's not recommended to change it and a website can't trust this value to reflect the actual intention of the user. It's best for site designers to avoid using language detection via this header as it can lead to a poor user experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>They should always provide a way to override the server-chosen language, e.g., by providing a language menu on the site. Most user agents provide a default value for the <code>Accept-Language</code> header that's adapted to the user interface language. End users often don't modify it because they either don't know how or aren't able to do so based on their computing environment.</li>
<li>Once a user has overridden the server-chosen language, a site should no longer use language detection and should stick with the explicitly chosen language. In other words, only entry pages for a site should use this header to select the proper language.</li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Though there are legitimate uses of this header for selecting content, <a href="Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent.htm">it's considered bad practice</a> to rely on it to define what features are supported by the user agent.</p>

It indicates the list of headers the server uses during the server-driven content negotiation phase. The <code>Vary</code> header is needed to inform the cache of the decision criteria so that it can reproduce it. This allows the cache to be functional while ensuring that the right content is served to the user.</p>
<p>The special value <code>*</code> means that the server-driven content negotiation also uses information not conveyed in a header to choose the appropriate content.</p>
<p>The <code>Vary</code> header was added in version 1.1 of HTTP and allows caches to work appropriately. To work with server-driven content negotiation, a cache needs to know which criteria the server used to select the transmitted content. That way, the cache can replay the algorithm and will be able to serve acceptable content directly, without more requests to the server. Obviously, the wildcard <code>*</code> prevents caching from occurring, as the cache can't know what element is behind it. For more information, see <a href="Caching.htm#vary">HTTP caching &gt; Varying responses</a>.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="agent-driven_negotiation"><h2 id="agent-driven_negotiation"><a href="#agent-driven_negotiation">Agent-driven negotiation</a></h2><div class="section-content"><p>Server-driven negotiation has a few drawbacks: it doesn't scale well. One header per feature is used in the negotiation. If you want to use screen size, resolution, or other dimensions, you need to create a new HTTP header. The headers must then be sent with every request. This isn't an issue if there are only a few headers, but as the number of headers increases, the message size could eventually affect performance. The more precisely headers are sent, the more entropy is sent, allowing for more HTTP fingerprinting and corresponding privacy concerns.</p>
<p>HTTP allows another negotiation type: <em>agent-driven negotiation</em> or <em>reactive negotiation</em>. In this case, the server sends back a page that contains links to the available alternative resources when faced with an ambiguous request. The user is presented the resources and chooses the one to use.</p>

The server has multiple resources represented by the URL and sends back multiple responses so the client may choose a body with a preferred compression algorithms applied." width="801" height="542" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the HTTP standard doesn't specify the format of the page for choosing between the available resources, which prevents the process from being automated. Besides falling back to the <em>server-driven negotiation</em>, this method is almost always used with scripting, especially with JavaScript redirection: after having checked for the negotiation criteria, the script performs the redirection. A second problem is that one more request is needed to fetch the real resource, slowing the availability of the resource to the user.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="see_also"><h2 id="see_also"><a href="#see_also">See also</a></h2><div class="section-content"><ul>
